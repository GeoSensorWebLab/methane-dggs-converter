2F,Product Uses as Substitutes for Ozone Depleting Substances,"CO2, HFCs, PFCs, other halogen ated gases"
2F1,Refrigeration and Air Conditioning,"Refrigeration and air-conditioning systems are usually classified in six application domains or categories. These categories utilize different technologies such as heat exchangers, expansion devices, piping and compressors. The six application domains are domestic refrigeration, commercial refrigeration, industrial processes, transport refrigeration, stationary air conditioning, and mobile air conditioning systems. For all these applications, various HFCs are selectively replacing CFCs and HCFCs. For example, in developed countries, HFC-134a has replaced CFC-12 in domestic refrigeration and mobile air conditioning systems, and blends of HFCs such as R-407C (HFC-32/HFC-125/HFC-134a) and R-410A (HFC-32/HFC-125) are replacing HCFC-22 mainly in stationary air conditioning. Other, non-HFC substances are used to replace CFCs and HCFCs such as iso-butane in domestic refrigeration or ammonia in industrial refrigeration. HFC- 152a is also being considered for mobile air conditioning in several regions. CO2, HFCs, PFCs, other halogenated gases"
2F1a,Refrigeration and Stationary Air Conditioning,"The application domains are domestic refrigeration, commercial refrigeration, industrial processes, and stationary air conditioning. CO2, HFCs, PFCs, other halogenated gases"
2F1b,Mobile Air Conditioning,"The applicati on domains are transport refrigeration, mobile air-conditioning systems. CO2, HFCs, PFCs, other halogenated gaseS"
2F2,Foam Blowing Agents,"HFCs are being used as replacements for CFCs and HCFCs in foams, particularly in closed-cell insulation applications. Compounds that are being used include HFC-245fa, HFC-365mfc, HFC-227ea, HFC-134a, and HFC-152a. The processes and applications for which these various HFCs are being used include insulation boards and panels, pipe sections, sprayed systems and one-component gap-filling foams. For open-cell foams, such as integral skin products for automotive steering wheels and facias, emissions of HFCs used as blowing agents are likely to occur during the manufacturing process. In closed-cell foam, emissions not only occur during the manufacturing phase, but usually extend into the in-use phase and often the majority of emissions occur at the end-of-life (de-commissioning losses) . Accordingly, emissions can occur over a period of up to 50 years or even longer. CO2, HFCs, PFCs, other halogenated gases"
2F3,Fire Protection,"There are two general types of fire protection (fire suppression) equipment that use greenhouse gases as partial replacements for halons: portable (streaming) equipment, and fixed (flooding) equipment. The non-ozone-depleting, industrial gases HFCs, PFCs and, more recently a fluoroketone are mainly used as substitutes for halons, typically halon 1301, in flooding equipment. PFCs played an early role in halon 1301 replacement but current use is limited to replenishment of previously installed systems. HFCs in portable equipment, ty pically replacing halon 1211, are available but have achieved very limited market acceptance due primarily to their high cost. PFC use in new portable extinguishers is currently limited to a small amount (few percent) in an HCFC blend. 2F3 CO2, HFCs, PFCs, other halogenated gases"
2F4,Aerosols,"Most aerosol packages now contain hydrocarbons (HC) as propellants, but in a small fraction of the total, HFCs and PFCs may be used as propellants or solvents. Emissions from aerosols usually occur shortly after production, on average, six months after sale. During the use of aerosols, 100% of the chemical is emitted. The 5 main sources are metered dose inhalers (MDIs), personal care products (e.g. hair care, deodorant, shaving cream), household products (e.g. air-fresheners, oven and fabric cleaners), industrial products (e.g. special cleaning sprays such as those for operating electrical contact, lubricants, pipe-freezers) and other general products (e.g. silly string, tire inflators, claxons), although in some regions the use of such general products is restricted. The HFCs currently used as propellants are HFC 134a, HFC 227ea, and HFC 152a. The substance HFC 43 10mee and a PFC, perfluorohexane, are used as solvents in industrial aerosol products. 2F4 HFCs, PFCs, other halogenated gases"
2F5,Solvents,"HFCs and, to a much lesser extent PFCs, are being used as substitutes for ozone-depleting substances (most notably CFC-113). Typical HFCs used are HFC-365mfc and HFC-43-10mee. Use of these fluorinated replacements is much less widespread than the ozone-depleting substances they replace. Re-capture and re-use is also much more widely practiced. The primary areas of use are precision cleaning, electroni cs cleaning, metal cleaning and deposition applications. Emissions from aerosols containing solvents should be reported under category 2F4 Aerosols rather than under this category. 2F5 HFCs, PFCs, other halogenated gases"
2F6,Other Applications (please specify),"The properties of ozone-depleting substances have made them attractive for a variety of niche applications not covered in other sub-source categories. These include electronics testing, heat transfer, dielectric fluid and medical applications. The properties of HFCs and PFCs are equally attractive in some of these sectors and they have been adopted as substitutes. There are also some historical uses of PFCs, as well as emerging uses of HFCs, in these applications. These applications have leakage rates ranging from 100% emissive in the year of application to around 1% per annum. 2F6 CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, other halogenated gases"

3B4aii,Flooded Land Remaining Flooded Land ,"Emissions from flooded land remaining flooded land. Flooded lands are defined as water bodies where human activities have caused changes in the amount of surface area covered by water, typically through water level regulation. Examples of flooded lands include reservoirs for the production of hydroelectricity, irrigation, navigation, etc. Regulated lakes and rivers that have not experienced substantial changes in water area in comparison with the pre-flooded ecosystem are not considered as flooded lands. Some rice paddies are cultivated through flooding of land, but because of the unique characteristics of rice cultivation, rice paddies are addressed in 3C7. CO2, CH4 N2O, NOx, CO, NMVOC, SO"
